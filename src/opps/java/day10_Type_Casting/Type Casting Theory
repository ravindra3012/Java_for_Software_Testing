Type Casting
----------------------------
Converting one type of data into another type is called as type casting.

Types
----------------------------
1) Up casting / Widening
2) Down casting / Narrowing


1) Up casting / Widening
----------------------------
converting value from smaller to larger
    eg-  int ----> long
         float ---> double

2) Down casting / Narrowing
----------------------------
converting value from larger to smaller
    eg- long ---> int
        double ---> float



Type Casting Object Rules

      Cat ct = (Cat) an;
       A   b     C    d
       A b = (C) d;
   Rule 1 : conversion is valid or not
   The type of 'd' and 'C' must have same relationship(either parent to child or child to parent)

   Rule 2 : assignment is valid or not
   'C' must be either same or child of 'A'

   Rule 3 :
   The underlying object type of 'd' must be either same or child of 'C'


note**
         Rule 1 and Rule 2 gives compile time exception (syntax error)
         Rule 3 gives run time exception (When you run the program)
