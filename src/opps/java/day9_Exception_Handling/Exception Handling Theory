Exception Handling
----------------------------------
Exception is an event which will cause program termination.


Errors
----------------------------------
1) syntax
2) logical


Types of Exceptions
----------------------------------
1) Checked exceptions
 The exception which are identified by java compiler
    eg.. InterruptedException
         FileNotFound
         IOException etc...

2) Un-checked Exceptions
 The exception which are not identified by java compiler
    eg.. ArithmeticException
         NullPointerException
         ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException etc...

1) Checked exceptions
---------------------------------
checked exception can be handled in 2 ways
1) using try...catch block
2) using throws


2) Un-checked Exceptions
---------------------------------
Syntax
---------------------------------

try
{
statements
}
catch(Exception name)
{
statements
}
finally                 // optional block
{
}




about finally block
-------------------------------------
case 1: Exception occurred, catch block handled ----> finally block will execute
case 1: Exception occurred, catch block Not handled ----> finally block will execute
case 1: Exception does not occurred, catch block ignored ----> finally block will execute

Why we need finally block



                Checked exception
1) Checked exception identify by java compiler
2) Checked exception handled using try..catch block as well as throws keyword
3) throws keyword is method level

                      vs

                un-checked exception
1) un-checked exception Not identify by java compiler
2) un-checked exception handled only using try..catch block
3) try..catch block is Statement level
